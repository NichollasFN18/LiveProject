# LiveProject
## Intro
My last 2 weeks at the Tech Academy were the most interactive and Realistic weeks that Could be. I was told from the beginning that i am being prepared for the Live project and that was true. The Live Project was the closest to real JOB experience as I could be without working. I was working with a team having meetings at 11 AM sharp every day, doing my own stories. Mine being attack and defense they came by pretty quick and simple.
