# LiveProject
## Intro
My last 2 weeks at the Tech Academy were the most interactive and Realistic weeks that Could be. I was told from the beginning that i am being prepared for the Live project and that was true. The Live Project was the closest to real JOB experience as I could be without working. I was working with a team having meetings at 11 AM sharp every day, doing my own stories. Mine being attack and defense they came by pretty quick and simple compared to others actually having to write out code. I enjoyed the attack and it actually came fairly simple to me as after going through the schooling I Realized that it actually is not that hard to Hack. The defense on the other hand was a little bit tricky because I didn't get how to put everything together until lately. I will show screenshots of things I found as well as of the Juice Shop hacking test website I was using to pass my attacking Stories!
